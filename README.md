# HackTX23
Budget Planner Consultant Extension for HackTX 2023
## Todo
* Make adding/"purchasing" item functtion (right now plus sign under the score doesn't do anything)
* Need to change extension icon
* Need to link the backend and frontend together

## Notes
* Need to figure how to communicate the .js files with the .py file and link frontend to backend. Python Flask?
* I think another manifest file might be necessary to setup native messaging between browser extension and native host(aka python script) but idk
* Getting the product name and price doesn't work
* Should try to implement detecting what website we are on
* Score number is randomly generated right now
## Features
